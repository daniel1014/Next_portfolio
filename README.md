### Key Features
- **Next.js Framework**: Utilizes the latest web technologies for a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **Floating Navigation Bar**: A visually appealing and functional navigation bar that remains accessible when users scroll up, meanwhile hides on scroll, thanks to [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/floating-navbar)
- **Error Monitoring**: Integrated Sentry for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring. User can provide any feedback/bug with the built-in screenshot functionality to the web developer (i.e. ME!).
- **Magical Button**: A absolute stunning, animated button inspired by [tailwindcss buttons](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/tailwindcss-buttons). It enhances user interaction and showcases advanced CSS and JavaScript techniques.

### Deployment 
This project is currently deployed through the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js. Alternatively, it can be deployed through any other deployment platform such as Azure Web App Services. 

### Ongoing Development
While I have extensive experience with AI technologies using Python, this portfolio represents my expansion into modern web development, particularly with Next.js and React. I'm actively working on integrating my AI expertise with these web technologies. For instance:

- The current AI chatbot shown is a placeholder, as I'm developing a real one using advanced AI techniques (e.g., Vercel SDK, langchain, vector database, etc.).
- Future updates will showcase the integration of AI models with responsive web interfaces.

### Skills and Learning Journey
This portfolio demonstrates:
1. My strong foundation in AI and machine learning using Python.
2. My growing expertise in modern web development frameworks and tools.
3. My ability to bridge AI technologies with cutting-edge web development practices.
4. My commitment to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies.

I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that combine AI capabilities with sophisticated web interfaces. This project not only showcases my current abilities but also my dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in tech.

I look forward to discussing how my unique combination of AI expertise and emerging web development skills can contribute to your team's goals and drive impactful innovation in AI and web technologies.
